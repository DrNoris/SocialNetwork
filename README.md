# Chill App

Welcome to the **Chill App**, a full-stack application designed and developed to showcase my skills in software engineering. This project was developed at one of my uni's classes and is now intended as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my proficiency in building applications. It offers essential features for online social interaction, such as account creation, messaging, and activity tracking.

## What I learned

- **Database Storage**: This was my first time using a database (PostgreSQL) for data persistence, and I gained a strong understanding of how to apps interact with relational databases.

- **Controllers**: I learned about the concept of controllers and how they manage communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Even though I have eperince in OOP (see my OOP repositories on my GitHub page) I applied various OOP principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and clean code practices to make the project maintainable and extensible.

- **Pagination**: Implemented pagination to efficiently handle large datasets in the UI.

## Beyond Requirements: 
### I loved this project so much that I implemented features beyond the university requirements, such as:

- Sending messages to multiple friends.

- Sending photos in chats.

- Replying to messages.

## Features

### User Management
- **Account Creation**: Users can sign up with a unique username and password.
- **Login**: Secure login functionality with validation.
- **Delete Account**: Users can delete their accounts permanently.

### Friend System
